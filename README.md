Binoculars


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.


It adds fully functional binoculars.
*Currently the binoculars do not spawn naturally in the world, so they have be created manually, e.g. by using [DeveloperConsole](https://github.com/FINDarkside/TLD-Developer-Console)*


This mod also requires [AssetLoader](https://github.com/WulfMarius/AssetLoader) and [ModComponent](https://github.com/WulfMarius/ModComponent).

So your mod directory should contain
- Binoculars.dll
- binoculars (the asset bundle)
- Assetloader.dll
- ModComponent.dll
- ModComponentMapper.dll


To be installed like a mod as described by [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller).
